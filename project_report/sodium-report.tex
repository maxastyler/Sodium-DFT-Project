\section{Introduction}

\section{Background}
\subsection{Crystal Structure}
\subsubsection{Bravais Lattice}
A Bravais lattice, $\mathcal{B}$, is a set of points infinitely repeated throughout space, with the property that the lattice looks the same viewed from any of these points. 
An $\mathbf{N}\mathrm{-dimensional}$ Bravais lattice can be generated by a set of $n$ linearly independent vectors, the lattice basis:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lattice_basis}
	\mathcal{V} = \{\mathbf{v}_1, \mathbf{v}_2, ..., \mathbf{v}_n\}
\end{equation}
The Bravais lattice can then be found by addition of these vectors each multiplied by some integer:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bravais_lattice}
	\mathcal{B} = \left \{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\mathbf{v}_i \Big | a_i \in \mathbb{Z}, \mathbf{v}_i \in \mathcal{V}  \right \}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{./figures/lattice_basis.png}
	\caption{A 2-dimensional Bravais lattice.}
	\label{fig:lattice_basis}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:lattice_basis} shows a 2-dimensional lattice with basis vectors $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$. Two Bravais lattices are considered equivalent if they are invariant under the same symmetry group. In 2 dimensions, there are 5 different Bravais lattices and in 3 dimensions, there are 14 \cite{kittel2005introduction}. The choice of a lattice basis for a certain Bravais lattice is not unique.
The Bravais lattice is invariant under translation by any of its basis vectors, meaning it is a periodic structure. 

Physical crystals also have an atomic basis consisting of a set of atoms and positions for these atoms. The atomic basis is repeated at each point on the underlying Bravais lattice and generates the physical crystal. 
A simple example is NaCl, which has a face-centred cubic Bravais lattice, and a 2 atom atomic basis (shown in figure \ref{fig:nacl_lattice}).

\end{figure*}
\subsubsection{The Unit Cell}
The unit cell is the set of points spanned by the lattice basis vectors, and is the repeating unit that the whole crystal is tiled up from (by translating it along all lattice vectors). Specifically, it is the set of points:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:unit_cell}
	\left\{\sum _{i=1}^n a_i \mathbf v_i \Big| a_i \in \mathbb{R}, 0<a_i<1, \mathbf{v}_i \in \mathcal V \right\}
\end{equation}
The volume of the unit cell is given by the determinant of the matrix made from placing its column basis vectors together:
\begin{equation}
	V = \det [\mathbf{v}_1 \mathbf{v}_2 ... \mathbf{v}_n]
\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Dual Lattice}
With every real lattice, we can associate a dual lattice in reciprocal space with basis vectors:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dual_basis}
	\mathcal{W} = \{\vec{\omega}_1, \vec \omega _2, ..., \vec{\omega}_n\}
\end{equation}
And a set of dual lattice points:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dual_lattice}
	\mathcal{G} = \left \{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\vec{\omega}_i \Big | a_i \in \mathbb{Z}, \vec{\omega}_i \in \mathcal{W}  \right \}
\end{equation}
The real and dual bases have the property:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf v _ i \cdot \vec\omega_j = 2\pi\delta_{ij}
\end{equation}
Due to the fact that the Bravais lattice is periodic, any observable will be periodic as well (For example, the electron density, $\rho(\mathbf{r})$\ ).

Since these observables will be periodic we have:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:periodic_observable}
	f(\mathbf r) = f(\mathbf r + \mathbf B) \text{ where } \mathbf B \in \mathcal B
\end{equation}
We can consider the fourier expansion of this function:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:f_fourier_expansion}
	f(\mathbf r + \mathbf B) = \sum_k f_k e ^ {i \mathbf G_k\cdot(\mathbf r + \mathbf B)} 
	= \sum _k f_k e ^ {i \mathbf G_k \cdot \mathbf r} e ^ {i \mathbf G_k \cdot \mathbf B}
\end{equation}
Where $\mathbf G_k \in \mathcal G$, $\sum_k$ is the sum over all vectors in $\mathcal G$ and the fourier component $f_k$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
	f_k = \frac{1}{V}\int_Cd\mathbf rf(\mathbf r)e^{-i\mathbf G_k\cdot \mathbf r}
\end{equation}
$C$ being the unit cell, and $V$ its volume.

Since equation \ref{eq:f_fourier_expansion} is true for $\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{0}$, this must mean that $e^{i\mathbf G_k\cdot \mathbf B_n} = 1$, $\forall k, n \in \mathbb{Z} $ and we have that $\mathbf G_k \cdot \mathbf B_n = 2\pi N$, $N\in \mathbb{Z}$. We can generate the dual lattice vectors from the real lattice vectors (using column-vectors for the real basis and row-vectors for the dual basis): 
\begin{gather}
	\vec{\omega}_i\cdot \mathbf{v}_j = 2\pi\delta_{ij} \\
	\begin{bmatrix} 
		\vec{\omega}_1 \\
		\vec{\omega}_2 \\
		\vdots \\
		\vec{\omega}_n \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\mathbf{v}_1
		\mathbf{v}_2
		...
		\mathbf{v}_n
	\end{bmatrix} = 2\pi
	\begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0  & ... & 0 \\
		0 & 1 &  ... & 0  \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		0 & 0 & \hdots & 1 
	\end{bmatrix}
	\\
	\begin{bmatrix} 
		\vec{\omega}_1 \\
		\vec{\omega}_2 \\
		\vdots \\
		\vec{\omega}_n \\
	\end{bmatrix}
	= 2\pi
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\mathbf{v}_1
		\mathbf{v}_2
		...
		\mathbf{v}_n
	\end{bmatrix} ^{-1}
\end{gather}
Since the lattices are related to each other through a fourier transform, the dual lattice to the dual lattice is the original lattice.
In 3 dimensions, the reciprocal lattice of the simple cubic lattice is the simple cubic lattice 
(with each vector having a reciprocal length), the reciprocal lattice of the FCC lattice is BCC, and vice versa.
\subsubsection{Bloch's Theorem}
The periodicity of the lattice leads to a constraint on the wavefunction of electrons in the crystal:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bloch_wave}
	\psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{r}}u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)
\end{equation}
Where $u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)$ has the same period as the crystal the wave is in.
We can prove this using the translation operator $\hat T_\mathbf B$ where $\hat T_\mathbf B f(\mathbf r) = f(\mathbf r + \mathbf B)$, and $\mathbf B$ is some lattice vector. Let $\psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)$ be an eigenstate of the translation operator:
\begin{equation}
	\hat T_\mathbf B \psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = A \psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)
\end{equation}
Since the state is normalised to unity, we can write $A=e^{i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf B}$. If we define another function, $u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = e^{-i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r}\psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)$ and then operate on it with the lattice translation operator:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bloch_proof}
\hat T_\mathbf B u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r + \mathbf B) = 
e^{-i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r}e^{-i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf B} \psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r + \mathbf B) = 
e^{-i\mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r}e^{i\mathbf k \cdot (\mathbf B - \mathbf B)} \psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)
\end{equation}
Which shows that $u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)$ has the same periodicity as the lattice. The relation $u_\mathbf k(\mathbf r) = e^{-i \mathbf k \cdot \mathbf r}\psi_\mathbf k(\mathbf r)$ is then inverted to get the result in equation \ref{eq:bloch_wave}.
\subsubsection{Electrons in the Lattice}
\subsection{Density Functional Theory}
\subsubsection{The Hohenberg-Kohn Theorems}
The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are two theorems which make density functional theory possible. They are stated as \cite{martin_2004}:
\begin{displayquote}
	\textbf{Theorem I}: For any system of interacting particles in an external potential $V_\mathrm{ext}(\mathbf r)$, the potential $V_\mathrm{ext}(\mathbf r)$ is determined uniquely, except for a constant, by the ground state particle density $n_0(\mathbf{r})$.
\\
	\textbf{Theorem II}: A \textit{universal functional} for the energy $E[n]$ in terms of the density $n(\mathbf r)$ can be defined, valid for any external potential $V_\mathrm{ext}(\mathbf r)$.
For any particular $V_\mathrm{ext}(\mathbf r)$, the exact ground state energy of the system is the global minimum value of this functional, and the density $n(\mathbf r)$ that minimizes the functional is the exact ground state density $n_0(\mathbf r)$.
\end{displayquote}
The proofs to these theorems are relatively simple, making use of the quantum variational principle \cite{shankar2012principles}.
To prove the first theorem, we consider two different hamiltonians $\hat H_1, \hat H_2$ with ground state wavefunctions $\bra{2}$
