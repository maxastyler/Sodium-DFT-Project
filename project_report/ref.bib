	abstract = {Universal variational functionals of densities, first-order density matrices, and natural spin-orbitals are explicitly displayed for variational calculations of ground states of interacting electrons in atoms, molecules, and solids. In all cases, the functionals search for constrained minima. In particular, following Percus [Formula: see text] is identified as the universal functional of Hohenberg and Kohn for the sum of the kinetic and electron{\textemdash}electron repulsion energies of an N-representable trial electron density ρ. Q[ρ] searches all antisymmetric wavefunctions Ψρ which yield the fixed. ρ. Q[ρ] then delivers that expectation value which is a minimum. Similarly, [Formula: see text] is shown to be the universal functional for the electron{\textemdash}electron repulsion energy of an N-representable trial first-order density matrix γ, where the actual external potential may be nonlocal as well as local. These universal functions do not require that a trial function for a variational calculation be associated with a ground state of some external potential. Thus, the v-representability problem, which is especially severe for trial first-order density matrices, has been solved. Universal variational functionals in Hartree{\textemdash}Fock and other restricted wavefunction theories are also presented. Finally, natural spin-orbital functional theory is compared with traditional orbital formulations in density functional theory.},

  abstract={QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.}
