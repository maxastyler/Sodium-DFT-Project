Calculating aluminium phonon things
Did tests on the aluminium for a cut off to work with, came up with ecut=30
Using a k-points grid of 12x12x12

Performing for cell dimension 7.6456

On calculating the displacement responses, using a 4x4x4 grid first, will see if this is enough by comparing the results of matdyn.x for an off-grid phonon to one from ph.x
If this is not enough, will bump the value up.

Calculating the constants with ph.x for a value of q, off-grid from the first 4x4x4 calculation (q=[0.6, 0.8, 0.3])
Will calculate this same point with matdyn.x and check too see if frequencies are similar.

Calculate phonon density of states once the force constants are calculated well enough.

The differences in diagonalisation are within 0.1, looks good enough???
Will go ahead and try to calculate phonon density of states.

17/10/31

Performed a new calculation for the phonon response grid at 12x12x12 q-points.
Then used matdyn.x to calculated density of states at a number of different resolutions.

The resolution 12x12x12 could be the best, as the higher the number of k-points in this calculation, the smoother the density of states gets. This is probably not wanted.


Performing the same calculations for aluminium in BCC. Minimum lattice parameter at 6.124

When calculating density of states with matdyn at 12x12x12, get negative frequencies.
Negative frequencies for lower values too.

--------------------------------------------------

Calculating again with k=20x20x20, q=12x12x12, ecutoff=40 for bcc because of the negative frequencies

17/11/01

This gives negative frequencies again... 
Looked online and saw some things saying that fqha.f90 is old, and the line checking w<-1 can be commented out, so the code only integrates over positive frequencies.
Trying this out.

--------------------------------------------------
The negative frequencies come from the fact that aluminium bcc is unstable. No amount of increasing the q-points/k-points can change this.

17/11/08

Need to calculate free energy of silicon, and alpha/beta tin and create a diagram.
Calculate at different values of V, then calculate T using the fqha.x to integrate the density of states. Once the density of states is integrated, we will have F as a function of V and T in certain points.

We really want energy as a function of Temperature and Pressure, so do a Legendre transform of F -> G (dF=-SdT-PdV) -> (dG=-SdT+VdP)

---maybe not true--- Want to find a way to interpolate F first, to get a continuous function of V, T then differentiate this to get P.

---probably true--- Look at the Murnaghan equation of state or the Birch Murnaghan equation of state for relation of P/V then invert to get V as a function of P

Interpolate the energy some way (using fourier interpolation/bicubic splines) Bicubic splines is probably the best method, as this is to be defined in a domain, and not a repeating function.


Using the condensed matter cluster can do the computations. Go to the ed wiki (wiki.ed.ac.uk) and search SGE to find a page with instructions.
Will need to ssh in ($ ssh -X s1333534@ph-cplab.ph.ed.ac.uk) then use qcommands to submit a job.

Can run smaller jobs on the cplab computers (ssh in to the main computer, then ssh into each smaller one) - this should be suitable for silicon.

Read Miguel's paper on Lithium.

Also, changing fqha.x to just ignore negative energy states was a bad idea - changing it back.

Check the convergence with Erho, and not just ecutwfc when using a non- norm conserving pseudopotential. It should be 8*the value rather than 4* with a norm-conserving.

--------------------------------------------------

Written a shell script to generate the phonons for a number of different values for silicon, and get the free energies.
The structure is unstable after lat_param = 10.37, and gives negative frequencies, so will only look up to then.

Writing a python script to plot the free energies as a function of temperature and volume(lattice parameter)

Need to include the electrons energy into the calculation of energy in the fe-calc.py script

Going to perform a much larger phonon run for silicon in the range 10.32-10.36 with a step of 0.001 (get 40 values)

Now have values that can be accessed with arange(10.2, 10.5, 0.01) ++ arange(10.32, 10.36, 0.001)

Added in the electrons energy, but the graph doesn't look converged enough.
Going to look into the density of states for each, as in the free energy graph for T=0, there is a jump at a=10.340->a=10.341 
Going to run phonon calculations in this small section to see what's going on.

Maybe plot the density of states here.

The discontinuity is still there for a=10.340->a=10.341 even with matdyn k=30x30x30.
The electron contribution to the energy has a minimum around 10.4, so I will expand around there to check the phonon contributions.

It's weird - the density of states is the same for 10.34->10.3403 then it jumps and stays the same until 10.341. Might be a problem with the simulation not being close enough to the lattice parameter.


Going to perform a new simulation around the minimum lattice parameter for the electron energy, at 10.4.

Values from 10.39 -> 10.41 with a spacing of 0.001.

These new values that I took now give negative frequencies in the density, but this is likely caused by too small a q-points value (I used 4x4x4) The values are n=-8 at maximum, and they are only at w slightly below 0, so I will discard these when I calculate the density of states.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

Modifying fqha.f90 and changing the line:
$ if ( nu(i) < -1.d0 ) then
to
$ if ( nu(i) < -1.d1 ) then

Hopefully this should be alright...

Recompiled this file

Silicon at 10.397 has negative frequency less than -1.d1 (by like 0.00001), moving the limit down to -11.d0

These plots still give nonsense around this minimum - in just the electron energy there's a large discontinuity. Going to play with the e_rho cutoff value, change it to 8x rather than 4x, and also change the k-points and q-points grids to 6x6x6, 6x6x6. (matdyn is probably still fine at 30x30x30)

Done tests with this pseudopotential at k=8x8x8, ecutwfc=18, ecutrho =144 and still not looking nice.

Need to perform convergence tests on this pseudopotential (si_pbe_v1.uspp.F.UPF.txt)

Steps:
1) Find the minimum by varying lattice parameter, holding constant ecutwfc=30, ecutrho=240, k=6x6x6
2) Vary ecutwfc at this minimum, keeping ecutrho as 8 x ecutwfc
Minimum found at a=10.333

Varying ecutwfc now.

At ecutwfc=30, the energy has converged to within 10e-4 rydbergs 
The pressure has converged to 10e-1kbar

Just doing a run for this with k=4x4x4 to check if the convergence is still there.
It is.
Will now do a little run around the minimum (10.333) for k=4x4x4 at ecutwfc=30, ecutrho=8*ecutwfc to check if the parabola is still nice, then time for a phonons run.

Yeah, it still works around k=4x4x4. Going to do more phonon runs, but instead up the E_rho to 8*ecutwfc. That was probably the mistake in the first place... 
Also a mistake was to not do it around the centre.

Split into chunks to do across different computers:
From a=10.28 -> 10.38 (step 0.002)
Lengths for different computers:

1 10.28 10.294
2 10.296 10.31
3 10.312 10.326
4 10.328 10.342
5 10.344 10.358
6 10.36 10.374
7 10.376 10.38

8 calculations for each

Connected to computers: -045- -047- -049- -053- -055- -058- -065-

Analysis for this shows that the free energies aren't too smooth around the equilibrium point. This could be due to the small q-points use around the minimum. Could run again with a larger q-points grid, larger matdyn grid (30x30x30 is the current) or just roll with it.

Instead of redoing the simulations, can fit a parabola at every value for T, to get a function F(V, T)=a(x-b)^2+c|T then generate a grid using this, and interpolate this new grid with splines. This will smooth out the bumps in the smaller grid and should give an alright energy surface.

Performing the free energy calculation for temperatures from T=0K to T=700K in 2K steps. (Melting point of Si is ~1400K, so performing integration up to 1/2 Tm_si is sensible)

Now have the helmholtz free energy F(T, V), free energy as a function of temperature and volume made with bicubic spline interpolation.

Want to get gibbs free energy G(T, P), free energy as a function of temperature and pressure.

Calculating the equilibrium lattice parameter of alpha tin. 

Using ultrasoft pseudo potential GBRV 1.4: sn_pbe_v1.4.uspp.F.UPF, so always setting ecutrho=8*ecutwfc

Alpha tin has a diamond structure - will perform scf calculations around the experimental lattice constant (6.4A~12Bohr)

|||||Need to add electron smearing to the beta tin simulation

For calculating the alpha tin, finding the lattice equilibrium with k=8x8x8, Ecutwfc=50

Done calculations around the lattice parameter for 12x12x12, ecut=50
This is not a smooth graph around the minimum - ecutwfc is probably not converged. Check convergence of this tomorrow.

--------------------------------------------------
17/11/12
--------------------------------------------------

Using the variation of lattice parameter around k=8x8x8 with ecutwfc=50, fitted a parabola to get a minimum at a=12.565 Bohr

Will check convergence of ecutwfc at this lattice parameter using a kpoints grid of 8x8x8

Convergence to within 1e-2 Ry at ecutwfc=50, ecutrho=400 for alpha tin at a=12.565 bohr.

Time to try out beta tin.

Using the sample input Miguel sent me as a starting point for the vc-relax simulation.

Calculating phonons for alpha tin.
Performing calculations at ecutwfc=50, ecutrho=400, k grid = 10x10x10, q grid = 8x8x8, m grid = 30x30x30, lats = 12.5 -> 12.7 in 0.01 steps

running on computers: 091 

Keep running into trouble with storage - the directories are ~ 1GB for each phonon calculation. Running multiple at once fills up far too much.

--------------------------------------------------
17/11/15
--------------------------------------------------

Done some sorting out of the graphs in Silicon-PT and Tin-PT.

Meeting with Miguel

- Show the silicon simulations (4x4x4 around min, varying ecut, free energies at different temperatures, zpe difference)
- Show the Alpha tin minimum find - gets stuck because not enough space on the server
- Show beta tin vc-relax (did I do this right?), can't find minimum, think I need a higher res grid, would need more space on the server.
- Groups command doesn't show that I'm on the cm server?
- I like the idea of fitting the birch murnaghan equation with bicubic spline interpolation between the points once this is fit.
- How to fit to B' in the birch murnaghan equation?

Things to do:

Use 86x86x60 input for the beta tin relaxation nr grid (both have common multiples)
USE 80x80x80 for relaxation

--------------------------------------------------
2017-11-21
--------------------------------------------------

Running beta tin relax with 80x80x80 relaxation fourier grid, 12x12x20 k-points on cplab 003

Perform phonon calculations for alpha tin with k=8x8x8, q=8x8x8, m_k=30x30x30 at 5 values between 12.45 and 12.8:
	   [ 12.45  ,  12.5375,  12.625 ,  12.7125,  12.8   ] {linspace(12.45, 12.8, 5)}
on cplabs: [ -004-    ,  -005-    ,  -009-    ,  -010-    ,  -012-    ]

FOR CALCULATING BURCH MURNAGHAN FIT:
Use ev.x. Need to have a set of files, one for each temperature formatted as:
LATTICE_PARAM 	ENERGY

Do for 5 different lattice params and 5 different temperatures up to ~800K

Phonon calculations are running slowly. Might need to split them up.

Had to stop phonon calculations as other people were using the cplab computers, can restart tonight/later on. They got to ~10/41

If I use 15 computers instead of 5 I could finish them tomorrow?
Then start using the cluster instead.


Have enthalpy vs pressure for different temperatures.
How to plot the surface?
Need to perform a cubic spline fit on PvE for each temperature, then calculate the PvT for the same pressures.

--------------------------------------------------
Meeting - 2017-11-22
--------------------------------------------------

- Look at stress convergence with everything constant, but k-points changing for scf eg. 6^3, 8^3, 10^3- alpha tin

Be careful with the conversion factors

- When probing at the lattice parameter, do more at high pressures rather than lower pressures, as the fits are fitted to high pressures (decompression doesn't behave as nicely)

-Calculate the phonons for alpha and beta tin at their equilibrium parameters, to get transition temperature, F(T), check which F is lower at certain temperatures.

Do vc-relax on beta tin targetting different pressures, around 0, with -0.25, -0.5Kbar minimum, going up in 5Kbars

--------------------------------------------------
2017-11-23
--------------------------------------------------

Calculating the convergence of alpha tin with respect to k-point grid size around the (expected) lattice minimum.

Running the calculation at lat_params [12.20 12.28 12.36 12.44 12.52 12.60 12.68] (seq 12.2 0.08 12.7)

On with k values (6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20) 

Running these calculations on the computers:
[12.20 12.28 12.36 12.44 12.52 12.60 12.68]
[-003-,   -004-, -005-,  -006-,  -007-,  -008-,  009]


With these values, plot the minima of abs(pressure)/energy vs lattice parameter for each k value, compare these curves.

Compared the curves and it looks like the pressure and energy have both converged at k=8x8x8, as even up to k=20x20x20 they don't coincide. Should ask miguel about this.

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/25
--------------------------------------------------

Doing phonon calculation for alpha tin as a=12.56 (my calculated minimum) with k=8x8x8, q=8x8x8. There are 29 q-points (with symmetries) splitting this between three computers:

[1-10, 11-20, 21-29]
[003,  004,   005]

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/26
--------------------------------------------------

Phonon calculations done for alpha tin at k=8x8x8,p=8x8x8, will check phonon dispersion curves against literature values.

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/29
--------------------------------------------------

The dispersion curves for 8x8x8 are ok, but there are some discrepancies between them and the literature values, especially between X-K
Running again at 10x10x10 curves has 47 phonon points.

List of 16 computers running each selection of phonons simulation:
[1 - 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 9, 10 - 12, 13 - 15, 16 - 18, 19 - 21, 22 - 24, 25 - 27, 28 - 30, 31 - 33, 34 - 36, 37 - 39, 40 - 42, 43 - 45, 46 - 47] 
[-004- ,-005- ,-006- ,-007-,   -008- ,    -009-,  -010-,   -011- ,  -012- ,  -013- ,  -014-  , -015-  , 016 , -017- , -018- , -019-]

2017/11/30
--------------------------------------------------

Writing a script that'll make it easier to split up a phonon run onto different computers
Done one that checks a list of computers and outputs ones that don't have anyone logged in.
Need to write one that takes a list of phonons to run, a list of computers and splits the phonons up to run on these computers, then outputs a file with computers and their corresponding phonons.

Some phoons failed to finish - running phonon 
42 on -007-

Hopefully they've all run fine now. Plotting the band structure again.

The band structure hasn't improved much on the change from k=8->k=10

I'm plotting 3 off-grid phonon points and seeing how they match up with the matdyn interpolation.
The points are: (computers)
0.05 0.55 -0.85  ( 020 )
-0.925 -0.175 0  ( 021 )
-0.55 0.55 0.95  ( 022 )

These have been calculated

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/5
--------------------------------------------------

Miguel emailed saying alpha tin's actually a semi-metal, meaning to simulate it I'd need to use smearing to get good answers. This is good - explains the problems I've been having.


Questions for the next meeting:

-Phonon irreducible representations? What are they? Irreps of the group that the force constants matrix is invariant under?
-Vc-relax, how to get more symmetrical cells?
-VC-relax, does relaxing change the cell dimension? Seems like only the volume's changed

Miguel ran alpha tin with a smearing of 0.02.

use tr2_convergence in phonons

Realised that I was using the wrong values for atom positions calculated from the beta sn relaxation. Whoops.
Changing those in the input script for the cluster.


Using those old values of atomic positions in the scf calculation gives stupid pressured (Order of 100Kbar)
Going to try relaxing again, using the output of the first vcrelax

Make sure to put in the units that the atoms/axes are in! (eg, alat, crystal, bohr...)

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/06
--------------------------------------------------

Did 2 more relaxations for beta sn using the last parameters calculated. These should now give nicer pressures.

Get a problem "q mesh breaks symmetry" when running the ph.x simulation. Going to try setting nq1=nq2=nq3=8.

see -> https://www.mail-archive.com/pw_forum@pwscf.org/msg29372.html

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/12
--------------------------------------------------

The q-symmetry problem is fine - just running simulations at 8x8x8 q-points.

Finished the script that splits up phonons and runs them on different computers. Finishing the ~40 phonons that the cm machine didn't finish on the computers now

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/13
--------------------------------------------------

Some phonons didn't finish, and need to be restarted:
phon-num | comp
20 | 062


Some are still running:

phon-num | comp
