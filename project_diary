Calculating aluminium phonon things
Did tests on the aluminium for a cut off to work with, came up with ecut=30
Using a k-points grid of 12x12x12

Performing for cell dimension 7.6456

On calculating the displacement responses, using a 4x4x4 grid first, will see if this is enough by comparing the results of matdyn.x for an off-grid phonon to one from ph.x
If this is not enough, will bump the value up.

Calculating the constants with ph.x for a value of q, off-grid from the first 4x4x4 calculation (q=[0.6, 0.8, 0.3])
Will calculate this same point with matdyn.x and check too see if frequencies are similar.

Calculate phonon density of states once the force constants are calculated well enough.

The differences in diagonalisation are within 0.1, looks good enough???
Will go ahead and try to calculate phonon density of states.

17/10/31

Performed a new calculation for the phonon response grid at 12x12x12 q-points.
Then used matdyn.x to calculated density of states at a number of different resolutions.

The resolution 12x12x12 could be the best, as the higher the number of k-points in this calculation, the smoother the density of states gets. This is probably not wanted.


Performing the same calculations for aluminium in BCC. Minimum lattice parameter at 6.124

When calculating density of states with matdyn at 12x12x12, get negative frequencies.
Negative frequencies for lower values too.

--------------------------------------------------

Calculating again with k=20x20x20, q=12x12x12, ecutoff=40 for bcc because of the negative frequencies

17/11/01

This gives negative frequencies again... 
Looked online and saw some things saying that fqha.f90 is old, and the line checking w<-1 can be commented out, so the code only integrates over positive frequencies.
Trying this out.

--------------------------------------------------
The negative frequencies come from the fact that aluminium bcc is unstable. No amount of increasing the q-points/k-points can change this.

17/11/08

Need to calculate free energy of silicon, and alpha/beta tin and create a diagram.
Calculate at different values of V, then calculate T using the fqha.x to integrate the density of states. Once the density of states is integrated, we will have F as a function of V and T in certain points.

We really want energy as a function of Temperature and Pressure, so do a Legendre transform of F -> G (dF=-SdT-PdV) -> (dG=-SdT+VdP)

---maybe not true--- Want to find a way to interpolate F first, to get a continuous function of V, T then differentiate this to get P.

---probably true--- Look at the Murnaghan equation of state or the Birch Murnaghan equation of state for relation of P/V then invert to get V as a function of P

Interpolate the energy some way (using fourier interpolation/bicubic splines) Bicubic splines is probably the best method, as this is to be defined in a domain, and not a repeating function.


Using the condensed matter cluster can do the computations. Go to the ed wiki (wiki.ed.ac.uk) and search SGE to find a page with instructions.
Will need to ssh in ($ ssh -X s1333534@ph-cplab.ph.ed.ac.uk) then use qcommands to submit a job.

Can run smaller jobs on the cplab computers (ssh in to the main computer, then ssh into each smaller one) - this should be suitable for silicon.

Read Miguel's paper on Lithium.

Also, changing fqha.x to just ignore negative energy states was a bad idea - changing it back.

Check the convergence with Erho, and not just ecutwfc when using a non- norm conserving pseudopotential. It should be 8*the value rather than 4* with a norm-conserving.

--------------------------------------------------

Written a shell script to generate the phonons for a number of different values for silicon, and get the free energies.
The structure is unstable after lat_param = 10.37, and gives negative frequencies, so will only look up to then.

Writing a python script to plot the free energies as a function of temperature and volume(lattice parameter)

Need to include the electrons energy into the calculation of energy in the fe-calc.py script

Going to perform a much larger phonon run for silicon in the range 10.32-10.36 with a step of 0.001 (get 40 values)

Now have values that can be accessed with arange(10.2, 10.5, 0.01) ++ arange(10.32, 10.36, 0.001)

Added in the electrons energy, but the graph doesn't look converged enough.
Going to look into the density of states for each, as in the free energy graph for T=0, there is a jump at a=10.340->a=10.341 
Going to run phonon calculations in this small section to see what's going on.

Maybe plot the density of states here.

The discontinuity is still there for a=10.340->a=10.341 even with matdyn k=30x30x30.
The electron contribution to the energy has a minimum around 10.4, so I will expand around there to check the phonon contributions.

It's weird - the density of states is the same for 10.34->10.3403 then it jumps and stays the same until 10.341. Might be a problem with the simulation not being close enough to the lattice parameter.


Going to perform a new simulation around the minimum lattice parameter for the electron energy, at 10.4.

Values from 10.39 -> 10.41 with a spacing of 0.001.

These new values that I took now give negative frequencies in the density, but this is likely caused by too small a q-points value (I used 4x4x4) The values are n=-8 at maximum, and they are only at w slightly below 0, so I will discard these when I calculate the density of states.

--------------------------------------------------
17/11/10
--------------------------------------------------

Modifying fqha.f90 and changing the line:
$ if ( nu(i) < -1.d0 ) then
to
$ if ( nu(i) < -1.d1 ) then

Hopefully this should be alright...

Recompiled this file

Silicon at 10.397 has negative frequency less than -1.d1 (by like 0.00001), moving the limit down to -11.d0

These plots still give nonsense around this minimum - in just the electron energy there's a large discontinuity. Going to play with the e_rho cutoff value, change it to 8x rather than 4x, and also change the k-points and q-points grids to 6x6x6, 6x6x6. (matdyn is probably still fine at 30x30x30)

Done tests with this pseudopotential at k=8x8x8, ecutwfc=18, ecutrho =144 and still not looking nice.

Need to perform convergence tests on this pseudopotential (si_pbe_v1.uspp.F.UPF.txt)

Steps:
1) Find the minimum by varying lattice parameter, holding constant ecutwfc=30, ecutrho=240, k=6x6x6
2) Vary ecutwfc at this minimum, keeping ecutrho as 8 x ecutwfc
Minimum found at a=10.333

Varying ecutwfc now.

At ecutwfc=30, the energy has converged to within 10e-4 rydbergs 
The pressure has converged to 10e-1kbar

Just doing a run for this with k=4x4x4 to check if the convergence is still there.
It is.
Will now do a little run around the minimum (10.333) for k=4x4x4 at ecutwfc=30, ecutrho=8*ecutwfc to check if the parabola is still nice, then time for a phonons run.

Yeah, it still works around k=4x4x4. Going to do more phonon runs, but instead up the E_rho to 8*ecutwfc. That was probably the mistake in the first place... 
Also a mistake was to not do it around the centre.

Split into chunks to do across different computers:
From a=10.28 -> 10.38 (step 0.002)
Lengths for different computers:

1 10.28 10.294
2 10.296 10.31
3 10.312 10.326
4 10.328 10.342
5 10.344 10.358
6 10.36 10.374
7 10.376 10.38

8 calculations for each

Connected to computers: -045- -047- -049- -053- -055- -058- -065-

Analysis for this shows that the free energies aren't too smooth around the equilibrium point. This could be due to the small q-points use around the minimum. Could run again with a larger q-points grid, larger matdyn grid (30x30x30 is the current) or just roll with it.

Instead of redoing the simulations, can fit a parabola at every value for T, to get a function F(V, T)=a(x-b)^2+c|T then generate a grid using this, and interpolate this new grid with splines. This will smooth out the bumps in the smaller grid and should give an alright energy surface.

Performing the free energy calculation for temperatures from T=0K to T=700K in 2K steps. (Melting point of Si is ~1400K, so performing integration up to 1/2 Tm_si is sensible)

Now have the helmholtz free energy F(T, V), free energy as a function of temperature and volume made with bicubic spline interpolation.

Want to get gibbs free energy G(T, P), free energy as a function of temperature and pressure.

Calculating the equilibrium lattice parameter of alpha tin. 

Using ultrasoft pseudo potential GBRV 1.4: sn_pbe_v1.4.uspp.F.UPF, so always setting ecutrho=8*ecutwfc

Alpha tin has a diamond structure - will perform scf calculations around the experimental lattice constant (6.4A~12Bohr)

|||||Need to add electron smearing to the beta tin simulation

For calculating the alpha tin, finding the lattice equilibrium with k=8x8x8, Ecutwfc=50

Done calculations around the lattice parameter for 12x12x12, ecut=50
This is not a smooth graph around the minimum - ecutwfc is probably not converged. Check convergence of this tomorrow.

--------------------------------------------------
17/11/12
--------------------------------------------------

Using the variation of lattice parameter around k=8x8x8 with ecutwfc=50, fitted a parabola to get a minimum at a=12.565 Bohr

Will check convergence of ecutwfc at this lattice parameter using a kpoints grid of 8x8x8

Convergence to within 1e-2 Ry at ecutwfc=50, ecutrho=400 for alpha tin at a=12.565 bohr.

Time to try out beta tin.

Using the sample input Miguel sent me as a starting point for the vc-relax simulation.

Calculating phonons for alpha tin.
Performing calculations at ecutwfc=50, ecutrho=400, k grid = 10x10x10, q grid = 8x8x8, m grid = 30x30x30, lats = 12.5 -> 12.7 in 0.01 steps

running on computers: 091 

Keep running into trouble with storage - the directories are ~ 1GB for each phonon calculation. Running multiple at once fills up far too much.

--------------------------------------------------
17/11/15
--------------------------------------------------

Done some sorting out of the graphs in Silicon-PT and Tin-PT.

Meeting with Miguel

- Show the silicon simulations (4x4x4 around min, varying ecut, free energies at different temperatures, zpe difference)
- Show the Alpha tin minimum find - gets stuck because not enough space on the server
- Show beta tin vc-relax (did I do this right?), can't find minimum, think I need a higher res grid, would need more space on the server.
- Groups command doesn't show that I'm on the cm server?
- I like the idea of fitting the birch murnaghan equation with bicubic spline interpolation between the points once this is fit.
- How to fit to B' in the birch murnaghan equation?

Things to do:

Use 86x86x60 input for the beta tin relaxation nr grid (both have common multiples)
USE 80x80x80 for relaxation

--------------------------------------------------
2017-11-21
--------------------------------------------------

Running beta tin relax with 80x80x80 relaxation fourier grid, 12x12x20 k-points on cplab 003

Perform phonon calculations for alpha tin with k=8x8x8, q=8x8x8, m_k=30x30x30 at 5 values between 12.45 and 12.8:
	   [ 12.45  ,  12.5375,  12.625 ,  12.7125,  12.8   ] {linspace(12.45, 12.8, 5)}
on cplabs: [ -004-    ,  -005-    ,  -009-    ,  -010-    ,  -012-    ]

FOR CALCULATING BURCH MURNAGHAN FIT:
Use ev.x. Need to have a set of files, one for each temperature formatted as:
LATTICE_PARAM 	ENERGY

Do for 5 different lattice params and 5 different temperatures up to ~800K

Phonon calculations are running slowly. Might need to split them up.

Had to stop phonon calculations as other people were using the cplab computers, can restart tonight/later on. They got to ~10/41

If I use 15 computers instead of 5 I could finish them tomorrow?
Then start using the cluster instead.


Have enthalpy vs pressure for different temperatures.
How to plot the surface?
Need to perform a cubic spline fit on PvE for each temperature, then calculate the PvT for the same pressures.

--------------------------------------------------
Meeting - 2017-11-22
--------------------------------------------------

- Look at stress convergence with everything constant, but k-points changing for scf eg. 6^3, 8^3, 10^3- alpha tin

Be careful with the conversion factors

- When probing at the lattice parameter, do more at high pressures rather than lower pressures, as the fits are fitted to high pressures (decompression doesn't behave as nicely)

-Calculate the phonons for alpha and beta tin at their equilibrium parameters, to get transition temperature, F(T), check which F is lower at certain temperatures.

Do vc-relax on beta tin targetting different pressures, around 0, with -0.25, -0.5Kbar minimum, going up in 5Kbars

--------------------------------------------------
2017-11-23
--------------------------------------------------

Calculating the convergence of alpha tin with respect to k-point grid size around the (expected) lattice minimum.

Running the calculation at lat_params [12.20 12.28 12.36 12.44 12.52 12.60 12.68] (seq 12.2 0.08 12.7)

On with k values (6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20) 

Running these calculations on the computers:
[12.20 12.28 12.36 12.44 12.52 12.60 12.68]
[-003-,   -004-, -005-,  -006-,  -007-,  -008-,  009]


With these values, plot the minima of abs(pressure)/energy vs lattice parameter for each k value, compare these curves.

Compared the curves and it looks like the pressure and energy have both converged at k=8x8x8, as even up to k=20x20x20 they don't coincide. Should ask miguel about this.

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/25
--------------------------------------------------

Doing phonon calculation for alpha tin as a=12.56 (my calculated minimum) with k=8x8x8, q=8x8x8. There are 29 q-points (with symmetries) splitting this between three computers:

[1-10, 11-20, 21-29]
[003,  004,   005]

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/26
--------------------------------------------------

Phonon calculations done for alpha tin at k=8x8x8,p=8x8x8, will check phonon dispersion curves against literature values.

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/29
--------------------------------------------------

The dispersion curves for 8x8x8 are ok, but there are some discrepancies between them and the literature values, especially between X-K
Running again at 10x10x10 curves has 47 phonon points.

List of 16 computers running each selection of phonons simulation:
[1 - 3, 4 - 6, 7 - 9, 10 - 12, 13 - 15, 16 - 18, 19 - 21, 22 - 24, 25 - 27, 28 - 30, 31 - 33, 34 - 36, 37 - 39, 40 - 42, 43 - 45, 46 - 47] 
[-004- ,-005- ,-006- ,-007-,   -008- ,    -009-,  -010-,   -011- ,  -012- ,  -013- ,  -014-  , -015-  , 016 , -017- , -018- , -019-]

--------------------------------------------------
2017/11/30
--------------------------------------------------

Writing a script that'll make it easier to split up a phonon run onto different computers
Done one that checks a list of computers and outputs ones that don't have anyone logged in.
Need to write one that takes a list of phonons to run, a list of computers and splits the phonons up to run on these computers, then outputs a file with computers and their corresponding phonons.

Some phoons failed to finish - running phonon 
42 on -007-

Hopefully they've all run fine now. Plotting the band structure again.

The band structure hasn't improved much on the change from k=8->k=10

I'm plotting 3 off-grid phonon points and seeing how they match up with the matdyn interpolation.
The points are: (computers)
0.05 0.55 -0.85  ( 020 )
-0.925 -0.175 0  ( 021 )
-0.55 0.55 0.95  ( 022 )

These have been calculated

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/5
--------------------------------------------------

Miguel emailed saying alpha tin's actually a semi-metal, meaning to simulate it I'd need to use smearing to get good answers. This is good - explains the problems I've been having.


Questions for the next meeting:

-Phonon irreducible representations? What are they? Irreps of the group that the force constants matrix is invariant under?
-Vc-relax, how to get more symmetrical cells?
-VC-relax, does relaxing change the cell dimension? Seems like only the volume's changed

Miguel ran alpha tin with a smearing of 0.02.

use tr2_convergence in phonons

Realised that I was using the wrong values for atom positions calculated from the beta sn relaxation. Whoops.
Changing those in the input script for the cluster.


Using those old values of atomic positions in the scf calculation gives stupid pressured (Order of 100Kbar)
Going to try relaxing again, using the output of the first vcrelax

Make sure to put in the units that the atoms/axes are in! (eg, alat, crystal, bohr...)

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/06
--------------------------------------------------

Did 2 more relaxations for beta sn using the last parameters calculated. These should now give nicer pressures.

Get a problem "q mesh breaks symmetry" when running the ph.x simulation. Going to try setting nq1=nq2=nq3=8.

see -> https://www.mail-archive.com/pw_forum@pwscf.org/msg29372.html

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/12
--------------------------------------------------

The q-symmetry problem is fine - just running simulations at 8x8x8 q-points.

Finished the script that splits up phonons and runs them on different computers. Finishing the ~40 phonons that the cm machine didn't finish on the computers now

--------------------------------------------------

Going to resubmit that single phonon (20) to run on the one day queue.

--------------------------------------------------
Testing out the pt fitting on the lithium data that miguel gave me.

I've made a directory in sodium_dft_project called Lithium_test which contains the data in bcc and fcc folders containing the ev.x output in files with the temperature in the filename.

Going to put this into a script and fit with bicubic splines.


need to add dft energy to the calculations with ev.x

- Finish beta tin - just those volumes
- Work on the PT code to try to get it working on lithium
- Initial work on sodium (bcc, fcc at different pressures, -> ~10GPa)
- Initial work on report

Email miguel next week, just to tell him how it's going

Meet miguel next january (10th or 17th) 

---------------------------------------------------
17/12/14
---------------------------------------------------

Beta tin has finally finished, checking the dispersion now.

When using asr='simple' in matdyn.x, get a lot of negative frequencies, and not very nice looking dispersion curves.

--------------------------------------------------
17/12/16
--------------------------------------------------

On calculating the sodium phonons:

First need to get a pseudo potential.
Using the SSSP website, downloaded the PBE pseudopotential collection (http://materialscloud.org/sssp/downloads.html) and will use the Na_pbe_v1.uspp.F.UPF from that collection.

Using this pseudopotential, first need to check convergence with cutoff energy.

Using the lattice constant of BCC Na, 429.06 pm/8.108 Bohr (http://periodictable.com/Elements/011/data.html)

Using m-v smearing with degaussing of 0.02 Ry

BCC sodium, ibrav = 3,
1 atom per unit cell,
1 type of atom
position is 0 0 0

Using 10^3 k-points.

With this measurement, choosing ecutwfc = 40Ry (ecutrho=320Ry) as the cutoff as the energies and pressures are converged to within (0.003Ry, 1kbar) at this point.

Use a value of k=20^3

The phonon calculations are complete for bcc. Just run density of state calculations with matdyn grid of 30x30x30. The phonons where 8.23... is the lattice parameter have negative frequencies. This is the crystal with a pressure of -1GPa. Going to do a new calculation at -0.5GPa and see what the negative phonons here are like.

Running lat param = 8.001... (-0.5GPa) on cplab 003
At lat param 7.85809 where pressure is -0.4Kbar, doing another phonon run at 7.86759... on cplab 006

--------------------------------------------------
2017/12/22
--------------------------------------------------

FCC and BCC have both finished. Using simple acoustic sum rule for matdyn gives a lot of negative frequencies, this problem doesn't go away with crystal asr.

--------------------------------------------------

For performing interpolation on the data, doing lithium first. Scipy's interp2d function doesn't really work. It is a special case of scipy's griddata function though, which I will try now.
Using griddata instead of interp2d does work. Gives values consistent with Miguel's original lithium analysis. Phew.

Performing the extraction on the sodium files that actually gave alright values (ones with no dos freq<0)
For temperatures, going from 0K->190K (Half sodium's melting temperature)

The pt fits with ev.x give relatively big differences between the simulated values for energy and the calculated values, indicating that the phonon simulation is probably not good enough. Going to continue and see if I get anything sensible when comparing FCC and BCC sodium.

Plot does not look nice. Will have to redo phonons at a higher q-point resolution.

--------------------------------------------------

For improving the calculations:

Change the convergence threshold in the scf calculation to ~ 10^-10
Then change the tr2_ph threshold in the phonon calculation to 10^-16
If possible, try increasing k-points to 20x20x20

Compute for 0GPa first.

--------------------------------------------------
Working on beta and alpha tin. Using the k=16x16x16, q=8x8x8 simulation for alpha tin, calculated the density of states. Performing a density of states integration up to 340K
The current phonons for alpha and beta tin don't work, should redo them.


Need to redo relaxation for beta tin and alpha tin to find for pressure = 0. Then calculate phonons at this point. Then look for transition temperature again.

-------------------------
Started a new repository (https://github.com/mtyler88/Tin-Transition), doing tin again. Relax both alpha and beta tin
Relaxation for beta running on cplab 005

Ones to do on the cluster:
1, 28, 32, 52, 55

Ones which are still running:

Some of these phonons finished - going to run the last lot on the sopa 1 day queue. Writing a script (beta-sn-s1333534) in the tin-transition repo to complete the last phonons

--------------------------------------------------
2017/01/26
--------------------------------------------------

Running a phonon calculation for fcc sodium again at pressure = 0GPa, with convergence threshold set to e-10 instead of e-8, same values otherwise (k=14^3, q=8^3)
Sodium phonons are so much faster than tin... (more symmetry, less modes)

Still substantial negative phonons at 0GPa. Will try running at 20^3 k-points, conv_thresh=10^-10, tr2_ph 1e-16

Phonons number 23 and 26 give problem too many k points (trying to use k-points 36000, in Modules/parameters.f90, npk is set to 40000, and in the check it breaks if 2*k-points>npk
Raising npk to be 80000, then recompiling quantum espresso (on the cplab machines).

Right, recompiled now with the greater npk number, trying to run again.

-------------------------
Going to try to work on sodium 9r. Using the lithium files for guidance - relax at 0GPa the 9r structure and run a phonon calculation to see if it's stable there.

Phonons completed for FCC Na at 0GPa. Upping the convergence threshold for k-points to 1e-10, increasing k-points to 20x20x20 and increasing the convergence for q-points to qe-16 helped. No more negative frequencies, seems to have converged.
Going to try to do a run at 0gpa with only 6x6x6 q-points, everything else constant. If this works, then I will redo all the fcc calculations with these new values. If 6x6x6 doesn't work, will redo with 8x8x8 q-points.

6x6x6 phonons seem alright. Going to set a few simulations going at different pressures for FCC with these new k-values, convergence values.

Already done 0GPa

Will get 5 values, so 4 more calculations:
-1GPa, 2.5GPa, 5GPa, 10GPa

The lattice parameters for each of these pressures:

Pressure (GPa) | Lat param (lattice units)
-1 |

FCC done now, and seems to be ok.
Running simulations for BCC sodium at same 5 pressures (-1, 0, 2.5, 5, 10) (GPa)

For meeting with Miguel tomorrow - get Tin values up to higher temperature, try to find crossing point of Alpha <-> Beta (Might be high, around 600K?)
Compare the values for FCC and BCC Na

--------------------------------------------------
2017/01/31
--------------------------------------------------

Added more phonons (7 different pressures for FCC Na and BCC Na), but the graph is still not looking nice. More error in the pt fits around 0GPa, so will run more phonons at those values.

--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------

Even with adding more phonons to the pt fit, it still gives rather large errors.  (Scales with 1/sqrt(N) at best)?
Might need to find another way.

There doesn't seem to be any transition above ~6GPa. I could try cutting values from there out of the PT fit, and see if the errors are reduced for the other values. Is this due to the breakdown of the quasi-harmonic approximation at those high pressures?

--------------------------------------------------
2017/02/13
--------------------------------------------------

Added some more phonon values for the Na FCC-BCC diagram, which improved it quite a lot. Will add more values, one for fcc at a lower pressure (~-0.8GPa) and at around 2GPa. Two more for bcc too, just to keep it even.

Will try plotting the diagram with more dense temperature, values every 10K rather than every 20K

I think the more dense temperature plotting gives a slightly better graph.

--------------------------------------------------

The na PT diagram is looking pretty good now with those added phonons. Have relaxed 9R to 0GPa (~0.01 kbar in the off diagonals in the pressure matrix, but this should be ok?)
Performing an scf calculation on the structure.

---Meeting with Miguel
Try fitting the phase line between BCC/FCC with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, or using critical exponent
Run the phonons for 9r at low phonon q-points (4x4x4) cause they are just too expensive...


---------------
Things to finish - check phonon of 9r at 0GPa at dyn8 (wherever that is) and see if it is non negative at higher electron scfs (eg. 30k-points)
Maybe do an hcp sodium at 0GPa, to check what the energy is like there.
Sodium is most probably a mix of different stuff down at that temperature/pressure (Transition temp @30K, which the calculations predict ~2x) This is the same situation as lithium though.


--------------------------------------------------

Higher quality phonons (scf 30^3 k points) for sodium at dyn8 (the one with negative frequencies from before) still give negative frequencies.

Relaxing sodium in HCP to check phonons of that structure at 0GPa.
