Already have a script to run on a cplab that checks computers to run on (check_comps_ssh) and a python script to split phonons between the computers (chunk_phonons.py)

Need a script which then takes these phonons and free computers and starts tmux sessions on each (with some session name) and runs the phonons. 

The output from chunk_phonons.py has the format

! nnn 
xx yy
xx yy

Where ! denote a computer with number nnn
and xx yy are the start phonon and stop phonon to be run in the ph.x script.

Write a script which runs on each computer, and takes the input list (xx yy, xx yy), calculates the electron density once, then loops through the phonons and calculates each dynamical matrix.

Once phonons are calculated, copy all the *.dyn* files to the folder where the script is located.
