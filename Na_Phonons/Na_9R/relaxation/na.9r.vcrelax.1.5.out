     Forces acting on atoms (cartesian axes, Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00000357   -0.00000357   -0.00000357
     atom    2 type  1   force =     0.00000357    0.00000357    0.00000357
     atom    3 type  1   force =     0.00000000    0.00000000   -0.00000000

     Total force =     0.000009     Total SCF correction =     0.000002
     SCF correction compared to forces is large: reduce conv_thr to get better values
